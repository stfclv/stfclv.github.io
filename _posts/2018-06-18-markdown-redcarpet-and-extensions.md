Redcarpet is a Ruby library for Markdown processing that smells like butterflies and popcorn.


Redcarpet was written by Vicent Martí. It is maintained by Robin Dupret and Matt Rogers.

Redcarpet would not be possible without the Sundown library and its authors (Natacha Porté, Vicent Martí, and its many awesome contributors).
