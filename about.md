At [Algolia][2], we love Jekyll, so we decided to provide an easy-to-use [Jekyll
plugin][3] to add an awesome search to your blog.


To make things even easier, we also [patched the Hyde theme][4] to give you an
example.


Hey ! Welcome to my Blog I know: a blog is totally old school.

Why not Facebook, Twitter or something new and more hip, Snapchat ? #kidding. I think 140 characters are not enough to explain complex thoughts or complicated things. Anyway, instead of jumping from customers to customers and facing exactly the same issues, I will report all the known issues [here][1]. 
With this search bar on the left-side, I will find out all my articles and troubleshooting done. :-)
