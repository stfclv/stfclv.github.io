You should check [this tutorial](https://community.algolia.com/jekyll-algolia/blog.html) to see how to build a front-end search that uses the `jekyll-algolia` plugin.

If you have any comments or questions, you should [open an issue](https://github.com/algolia/jekyll-algolia/issues) on the `jekyll-algolia` repository.
