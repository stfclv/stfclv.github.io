<p>Last month has been truly electrifying! We joined our friends at
<a href="http://www.yakaz.com/">Yakaz</a> in their office space, we participated in many
events... and most exciting of all, we spent days and nights reworking the
product! Today we are really proud to present you the result of this time well
spent!</p>

<p>I know I told some of you beta3 would be the last, but we could not ignore
your excellent feedback. So here comes Algolia Search beta4, a true revolution
(I hope this is not trademarked!) in mobile search!</p>

<p>Here come the major improvements:</p>

<ul>
<li>A completely <strong>reworked API</strong> that we just love to use everywhere. The time to fully understand the library has been reduced to nearly nothing thanks to all your feedback. We are proud to have the easiest to use search library ever made!</li>
<li>A completely <strong>rewritten documentation</strong> with detailed API and step-by-step tutorials. You should be able to make your first queries in a matter of minutes!</li>
<li><strong>Easy highlight</strong> for <strong>multiple fields queries</strong>. A bit cryptic? Stay with me... just imagine a Contact application where you can search for your contact by any field, i.e., name, company, address or even notes. Algolia Search now provides easy-to-use highlighting of any matching words. It is even able to generate a snippet when the text is too long. Check out the tutorials to learn more! Highlighting relevant results just became child&#39;s play!</li>
<li>A greatly <strong>improved out-of-the-box relevance</strong>. Our mission is to simplify search: we want the best possible relevance by default so you can forget these long hours of tuning :)</li>
</ul>

<p>But that&#39;s not all, many smaller improvements were also included in this
release:</p>

<ul>
<li>Support of <strong>advanced queries</strong>. Take again our tutorial contact application, wouldn&#39;t it be great to be able to search by initials? You can now implement this cool feature in a couple of minutes without any headache on relevance tuning.</li>
<li>Support for <strong>ARC and no ARC</strong>. In the previous beta we added an iOS version for people that do not use <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#releasenotes/ObjectiveC/RN-TransitioningToARC/Introduction/Introduction.html">Automatic Reference Counting (ARC)</a>. We now have only one version that supports projects with and without ARC. If you do not use ARC, all objects received from Algolia Search are autoreleased.</li>
<li>Support for <strong>user objects backward compatibility</strong>. As the index is also an objects store, you can modify your object members and still read older indexes! It is very easy to implement, just check the tutorials.</li>
<li>The release also fixes a few bugs that we discovered during your and our intensive testing.</li>
</ul>

<p>It would not have been possible without the help of our many beta testers,
thank you all! Special thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/krmarkel">Kris</a>,
<a href="https://twitter.com/dinh_viet_hoa">Hoa</a> and
<a href="https://twitter.com/sarfata">Thomas</a> whose guidance has been priceless.</p>

<p>So... what&#39;s next? Many things! This time I really believe this is the last
beta. The final release is just around the corner. Of course, we appreciate
your feedback nonetheless and always will! You can also expect a new website
and a few apps in the app store! Who said a contact app?</p>

<p>Stay tuned!</p>

        A few thoughts after Apps World
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">07 Oct 2012</span>

    <p>Last week provided me with an occasion to feel the tempo of the mobile
ecosystem at Apps World in London. Here are a few thoughts about what I saw.</p>

<p><img src="/algoliasearch-jekyll-hyde/assets/appsworld-300x224.jpg" alt="">There were many many mobile agencies
exhibiting... and local UK agencies were dwarfed in number by offshore ones,
hailing mainly from India. Eastern European countries also had an important
presence, especially Poland. It seems that the golden days of apps development
are behind us. Most big companies now outsource their apps offshore. It also
means that it&#39;s becoming very important for local agencies to differentiate
themselves. I actually pitched many of them about Algolia Search and
differences in reactions were interesting. Most Indian based agencies didn&#39;t
have a second look; They preferred to wait for &quot;requirements&quot; from their
customers. On the other hands European ones were on average much more
interested in what they could do with such a lib. The most geniune interest
always came from technical guys when they were present. By the way, if I could
give advice to any agency participating in such a event, please come with at
least a developer, and at best your CTO. You would gain much credibility and
differentiation!</p>

<p>Out of all of the agencies, a few other disciplines were well represented...
actually I may say &quot;too much&quot; represented as it often indicates an over-
crowded field and a battle for survival!</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Testing and QA services</strong>. Offshore Indian firms are also very active in this space.</li>
<li><strong>Ad platforms and payment tools</strong>. I didn&#39;t know there were so many options to choose from! Competition seemed harsh to get the attention of the few apps developers attending.</li>
<li>And most of all <strong>cross-platform HTML5 frameworks</strong>! I&#39;m not a big fan of PhoneGap and consorts, even if I admit it&#39;s a good choice for some apps, especially &quot;enterprise&quot; ones. The space is so crowded with offers now, that many may not survive the next year! By the way if you want to offer a framework and want to differentiate yourself with a cutting-edge search functionality, you know how to contact me ;)</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/algoliasearch-jekyll-hyde/assets/blackberry-300x224.jpg" alt="Blackberry at Apps World"></p>

<p>Two companies had a particularly important presence at the event compared to
what we could have expected:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>RIM</strong>, with probably the nicest booth of all. They proposed BlackBerry porting classes, offered developer guidance and gave several workshop speeches. After their recent commitment to <a href="http://devblog.blackberry.com/2012/09/built-for-blackberry-10k-developer-commitment/">paying BlackBerry 10 developers a minimum of $10K</a>, they continue to do all they can to attract developers. But I&#39;m afraid I agree with Charlie Kindel that <a href="http://ceklog.kindel.com/2012/09/26/paying-developers-is-a-bad-idea/">paying developers is a bad idea</a>!</li>
<li><strong>Twilio</strong>, actively promoting their voice and SMS APIs. Their immense success reminds us that there are still billions of feature phones out there!</li>
</ul>

<p>The other less surprising major players included Samsung and Microsoft, but no
Google and no Apple (not unexpected!). Of course, they were present in many
conversations! I had for example a very interesting chat with <a href="http://twistedhq.com">Adam
Hościło</a> about the many opportunities provided by the
new iOS 6 Passbook. It&#39;s opening a golden area for many in the next few
months!</p>

    <span class="post-date">28 Sep 2012</span>

    <p>With the summer behind us, the period is pretty active. It&#39;s really difficult
to attend all the great events, big and small, organized out there. After
<a href="http://www.mobilemondayfrance.org/">Mobile Monday</a>,
<a href="http://france.thefailcon.com/">Failcon</a> and the first meeting of
<a href="http://appsterdam.rs/">Appsterdam</a> Paris this week, here are the major mobile
app conferences we&#39;re attending in the next few weeks!</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.apps-world.net/europe/">Appsworld</a>, the 2nd and 3rd of October in London. It&#39;s a major event attended by lot of mobile industry professionals. There are expecting up to 5000 participants!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.mobility-for-business.com/">Mobility for business</a>, the 11th and 12th of October in Paris. A big event too, they are expecting about 3000 attendees!</li>
<li><a href="http://appdays.fr/">Appdays</a>, the 9th of November in Paris. A more human sized event (200 participants) and definitely a place to be!</li>
</ul>

<p>If you happen to participate to one of these, get in touch for some passionate
discussion around mobile apps development!</p>

        Algolia Search Beta 3 is out!
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">24 Sep 2012</span>

    <p><a href="https://blog.algolia.com/wp-%0Acontent/uploads/2012/09/CitiesSuggestIOSPortraitSmall.png"><img src="/algoliasearch-jekyll-hyde/assets/CitiesSuggestIOSPortraitSmall-155x300.png" alt="Algolia Search Beta 3"></a>We are pleased to
announce Algolia Search Beta 3, our third release with a strong focus on
performance.</p>

<p>As for the previous release, we would like to sincerely thank all of our beta
testers for their excellent feedbacks!</p>

<p>Here what&#39;s new in this beta3.</p>

<p><strong>iOS &amp; Android changes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Ultra fast loading</strong>: indexes are now loaded in a few milliseconds (always less<br>
than 10ms!)  With the Beta 2, an index of 500MB could take up to 20 seconds to
load.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ultra fast search on big indexes</strong>: Beta 2 was able to search up to 100k entries<br>
in real time. Beta3 can search in <strong>5M entries in real time</strong> (and probably</p></li>
</ul>

<p>more!). Our main use case was to search in all titles of the English version
of</p>

<p>Wikipedia on a IPhone 3GS. The speedup is also very nice for small datasets,</p>

<p>the near-zero CPU usage increases battery life compared to Beta 2.</p>

<ul>
<li>Highlight is now always done on longest match. In previous version a query &#39;anq&#39; could highlight &quot;Angeles&quot; in<br>
two different ways: &quot;<strong>Ang</strong>eles&quot; or &quot;<strong>An</strong>geles&quot;, with this version you will
always obtain &quot;<strong>Ang</strong>eles&quot; which is easier to</li>
</ul>

<p>understand for end-users.</p>

<ul>
<li>Improved proximity scoring when a query contains multiple words.</li>
<li>Fixed two memory leaks that could lead to problems with very heavy usage.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>iOS specific changes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Added a version without ARC that allows to target iOS &gt;= 3.0</li>
</ul>

<p>And here what&#39;s new in this beta2.</p>

<p><strong>iOS &amp; Android changes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Reworked the overview</li>
<li>Fixed a lot of typos and small errors</li>
